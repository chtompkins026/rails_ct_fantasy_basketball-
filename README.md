# rails_ct_fantasy_basketball-

Hello, this is an app that mimics the functionality of a fantasy basketball league. You can sign-up, login (either via your credentials or through Github's omniauth) and start creating teams, joining leagues, and adding/removing players from your team! This app's functionality is rather straightforward, but the backend is where the real magic and fun occur. To get started, simply follow the video below. You just need to:

1) Fork or clone the repo from:  https://github.com/chtompkins026/rails_ct_fantasy_basketball-

2) Open your terminal and run rake db:migrate && rake db:seed && rake db:populate

3) Run Rails s in your terminal

For more information and to see how to use the app, please watch this short demo below
